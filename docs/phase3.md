# Phase 3: Deployment and MVP Launch

## Objectives
Prepare the Kaizen Planning SaaS for production by deploying all core features, configuring a secure and scalable environment, and making the MVP accessible for initial users.

---

## Tasks and Details

### 1. **Codebase Finalization**
#### Code Cleanup
- Remove unused or deprecated code.
- Organize project structure for scalability (e.g., `/pages`, `/components`, `/api`, `/styles`).
- Ensure consistent formatting with Prettier and ESLint:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  npm run format
  ```

#### Performance Optimization
- Optimize Next.js pages:
  - Use `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` for dynamic/static data fetching.
  - Implement lazy loading for non-critical components and images.
- Minify CSS and JavaScript using built-in Next.js optimizations.
- Enable caching headers for static assets.

---

### 2. **Environment Configuration**
#### Environment Variables
- Verify all required variables are set in `.env.local` for production:
  ```env
  MONGODB_URI=your_production_database_uri
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_production_google_client_id
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_production_google_client_secret
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
  ```
- Use Vercel's Environment Variables for secure storage.

#### Security Setup
- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
- Ensure sensitive data (e.g., tokens, credentials) are encrypted during storage and transit.

---

### 3. **Deployment**
#### Vercel Deployment
- Deploy the Next.js application to Vercel:
  ```bash
  vercel deploy
  ```
- Monitor deployment logs for issues and address warnings or errors.
- Test the live site for responsiveness and core functionality.

#### MongoDB Atlas
- Scale the database cluster to handle initial user load.
- Set up automated backups for disaster recovery.

---

### 4. **Monitoring and Analytics**
#### Error Tracking
- Integrate Sentry for real-time error monitoring:
  ```bash
  npm install @sentry/nextjs
  npx @sentry/wizard -i nextjs
  ```
- Configure Sentry in `sentry.server.config.js` and `sentry.client.config.js`.

#### Usage Analytics
- Add Google Analytics to track user interactions:
  - Configure event tracking for actions like task creation and calendar sync.

---

### 5. **Quality Assurance**
#### Functional Testing
- Test the application in a production-like environment:
  - Step-by-step forms for task input.
  - Consolidated preview functionality.
  - Google Calendar synchronization.

#### Compatibility Testing
- Test the app on various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).

---

### 6. **MVP Launch**
#### Soft Launch
- Release the MVP to a controlled group of users.
- Provide a feedback mechanism (e.g., Google Forms or in-app feedback).

#### Final Adjustments
- Address critical issues reported by users during the soft launch.
- Prepare a release announcement for the broader audience.

## Deliverables
1. Fully deployed and functional application on Vercel.
2. Configured and scaled MongoDB Atlas database.
3. Integrated monitoring and analytics tools.
4. Secure and optimized environment for initial users.
5. Soft-launched MVP with feedback collection in place.

# Kaizen Planning SaaS: Application Architecture

## Architecture Overview
This document outlines the overall architecture of the Kaizen Planning SaaS application. It includes components, integrations, data flows, and the stack choices for the frontend, backend, and external APIs.

---

## Component Breakdown

### 1. **Frontend**
- **Framework**: Next.js
  - Server-side rendering (SSR) for dynamic pages like user-specific schedules.
  - Static site generation (SSG) for public pages like onboarding and methodology explanations.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or Chakra UI for responsive and modern design.
- **State Management**: React Query for API data handling and caching.
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for secure login and Google Calendar authentication.

### 2. **Backend**
- **API Layer**: Built-in Next.js API routes for handling user requests.
  - REST API for standard CRUD operations.
  - Webhooks for syncing with Google Calendar.
- **Business Logic**: Modular services for task segmentation, prioritization, and scheduling.
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose ORM) for efficient storage of user tasks, plans, and settings.

### 3. **Integrations**
- **Google Calendar API**:
  - OAuth 2.0 for user authentication and permission handling.
  - API calls for creating, updating, and deleting calendar events.
- **OpenAI API (ChatGPT)**:
  - Intelligent task segmentation and prioritization (future feature).
  - Query optimization for custom user feedback.

### 4. **Hosting**
- **Frontend and Backend**: Vercel for fast deployment and scalability.
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas for managed cloud database services.

## Data Flow

### 1. **User Onboarding**
- User accesses the app and optionally logs in using NextAuth.
- Onboarding steps provide an introduction to the methodology.

### 2. **Form Submission Workflow**
#### a. Data Input
- Users input data into step-by-step forms.
- Data is sent to Next.js API routes and stored in MongoDB.

#### b. Consolidation and Preview
- Consolidated data fetched from MongoDB.
- Preview rendered using React components.

#### c. Finalization and Export
- User confirms the plan.
- API call to Google Calendar to synchronize tasks as events.

### 3. **Continuous Improvement**
- Users revisit the app to edit plans.
- Historical data analyzed for recommendations.
